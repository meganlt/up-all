# Prime Solo Project

Authors: Junior Avalos, Jake Berg, Megan Tegeder, Will Shuford, Michael Silas

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
We built a web application designed to **enhance manager/employee relationships** through structured 1:1 meetings, engagement tracking, and leadership development tools. Built for [UpAll](https://upallleaders.com) to address: 
- 70% employee engagement (costing $350B annually)
- 6% engagement drop in remote/hybrid work
- Lack of tools for tracking psychological drivers of performance

**Key Outcomes** 
- 43% lower turnover ðŸ“‰
- 18% higher productivity ðŸ“ˆ
- 23% increased profitability ðŸ’°

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd up-all
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   From the root directory of the project, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create Environment Variables**
   Create a file in the root directory named `.env` and add the following:
   ```plaintext
   SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=yourSuperSecretStringHere
   ```
   Replace `yourSuperSecretStringHere` with a strong, randomly generated secret.

4. **Start the Server and Client**
   - In one terminal, run:
     ```bash
     npm run server
     ```
   - In another terminal, run:
     ```bash
     npm run client
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.

## Database Setup

1. **Create Database**
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database (default name is `prime_app`). If you use a different name, update the connection details in `pool.js`.

2. **Create Tables**
   - Run the SQL commands found in `database.sql` to create the necessary tables (e.g., the `user` table).

3. **Insert Initial Data**
   - Use SQL statements to seed your database. For example, insert a user:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO "user" (
       "username", "email", "password", "role", "first_name", "last_name",
       "pronouns", "company", "job_title", "manager_assigned"
     )
     VALUES
     ('mharper', 'mharper@email.com', 'temp1234', 'manager', 'Megan', 'Harper',
      'she/her', 'Acme Inc', 'People Manager', NULL);
     ```
   - Add additional dummy data as needed for testing.
